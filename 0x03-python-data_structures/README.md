File 0 - A function that prints all integers of a list.

File 1 - A function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

File 2 - A function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).

File 3 - A function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

File 4 - A function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).

File 5 - A function that removes all characters c and C from a string.

File 6 - A function that prints a matrix of integers.

File 7 - A function that adds 2 tuples.

File 8 - A function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

File 9 - A function that finds the biggest integer of a list.

File 10 - A function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

File 11 - A function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.

File 12 - Completion of a code in order to switch the value of a and b.

File 13 - A function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

File 14 - A C function that prints some basic info about Python lists.
